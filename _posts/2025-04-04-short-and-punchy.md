An unfortunate pattern pervades the world of nonfiction books. Every chapter begins with
a drawn-out story, before the author eventually circles back to reveal its central lesson.

This formula pads a dozen pages of useful information into a 200+ page slog. Instead of reading the
book in an afternoon, it might take you weeks to work through (if you finish it at all).

I don't know if the root cause is the author's [quest for status](https://borretti.me/article/non-fiction-has-bad-incentives),
the publisher enforcing their prescribed formula, or something else. Either way, the reader loses.

We should celebrate the books that eschew this blueprint, delivering a clear and forceful message
while staying concise and considerate of the reader's time.
