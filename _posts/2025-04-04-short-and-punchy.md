A lamentable formula has taken root in the world of nonfiction writing. Every chapter begins with
a drawn-out story, before the author eventually circles back to reveal its central lesson. 

This formula pads what could often be a blog post into a 200+ page tome. Instead of reading it in
an afternoon, it might take you weeks (if you finish it at all).

We should celebrate those books that eschew this blueprint, delivering a clear and forceful message
while staying concise and considerate of the reader's time.

Below are a few of my favourite "short and punchy" authors and books.
