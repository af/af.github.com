title: 2023 Review

Hard to believe I have been doing these annual posts for over a decade now. Revisiting some of the
old entries triggered a strange mix of nostalgia and cringiness. But I am compelled, against all reason, to keep going! And thus, this post exists.

## New Tech

Dunking on the Rube Goldberg-esque complexity of the JavaScript ecosystem has been a well-trodden trope for
years. So it has been very refreshing to spend some time playing with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) in
late 2023. It's oversold as a "drop-in Node replacement", as many compatibility issues remain, but the speed and simplicity is a breath of fresh air. Bun's pace of development is truly impressive, too, and despite the lack of a sustainable funding model, it's been so fun to use that I'm considering moving a few projects from Node to Bun this year.

Of course LLMs were a fascinating topic in 2023. [Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.com/) was, and continues to be, an engineering generalist's essential reading on the topic. ML is very far from my circle of competence but it's been fun to learn about a new field that is deep and fascinating.

## Reading

Regular readers of the blog (are there any?) will be familiar with my annual vanity metric– number
of books read in the year. Even as I smashed my previous record this year, I realized how pointless
and counter-productive this number is, given I retain very little of what I read. For 2024 my goal is to take a full page of notes for **20** high-quality books. I did this for only 9 books last year.

Retention issues aside, I enjoyed quite a few reads this year. Favourites were:

* **Rusty Brown** Chris Ware
* **Same as Ever** Morgan Housel
* **Drive** Dan Pink
* **Outlive** Peter Attia
* **Competing against Luck** Christensen et al
* **Building a Second Brain** Tiago Forte
* **From Strength to Strength** Arthur Brooks
* **Clear Thinking** Shane Parrish
* **Exhalation** Ted Chiang
* **Just Keep Buying** Nick Maggiuli
* **The Remains of the Day** Kazuo Ishiguro
* **You are Here** Thich Nhat Hanh
* **Invisible Boy** Harrison Mooney
* **Dilla Time** Dan Charnas
* **Hark! A Vagrant** and **Ducks** Kate Beaton
* **Lost and Founder** Rand Fishkin
* **Refactoring UI** Wathan & Schoger
* **Turning Pro** Steven Pressfield
* **Mind MGMT – Omnibus 1** Matt Kindt
* **Be Useful** Schwarzenegger

## Blogging and such

Last year I wrote down some nifty indieweb tech that I thought would be cool to explore on this
site, and predictably, none of those things came to fruition. One day, maybe. As usual
I didn't really write anything here, though I did do a little blogging [elsewhere](https://hyperpaper.me/blog). A few people even told me those posts were useful, which, if true, is probably a first for me.
